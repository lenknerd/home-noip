		<h2>King Still Has It</h2>
		<h4>Dennis McPherson, Tribute News Service</h4>
		<p>Stephen King has treated us over the years to a wealth of thoroughly enjoyable and spine-tingling thrillers, and his new novel, 'Revenge of the <span class="swap-output upc title-pnoun1_"></span>', is a worthy addition to the oeuvre.</p>
		
<!-- REMINDERS ON SYNTAX
		<p>Once upon a time there was a <span class="swap-output test-noun1_"></span>.  It
		  was a pretty good one too.  That corresponds to a 'swap-input' class with id 'test-noun1 (without the _ at the end).
		</p>
		<p><span class="swap-output upc test-noun1_"></span> should be upper case regardless.
		</p>
		<p>This: "<span class="swap-output loc test-noun1_"></span>" should be lower case regardless.
