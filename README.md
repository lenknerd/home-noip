David Lenkner's Home Page
=========================

My home page!  Contains some professional information (resume mainly) as well as a few pages I developed just for fun.  It is not currently in service but hopefully will be soon at lenknerd.com.

The site uses the following packages;

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Backbone Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/)
* [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/)

Thanks to their creators for making these available!
