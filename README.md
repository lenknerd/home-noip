David Lenkner's Home Page
=========================

My home page!  Contains some professional information (resume mainly) as well as a few pages I developed just for fun.  It served from my LAMP stack at home and can be viewed at [http://lenknerd.no-ip.org](http://lenknerd.no-ip.org).

The site uses Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and also [Backbone Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/).  Thanks to their creators for making those publicly available!

### To-Do Items

This site is currently under construction and there is much to do... in no particular order,

* Make the site.  It is just started, nothing but this readme file.
