My home page!  Contains some professional information (resume mainly) as well as a few pages I developed just for fun.  It is served from my LAMP stack at home and can be viewed at [http://lenknerd.no-ip.org](http://lenknerd.no-ip.org).

The site uses [will use] the following packages;

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

Thanks to their creators for making these available!

### To-Do Items

This site is currently under construction and there is much to do... in no particular order,

* Implement log-in page to link via https (check if https)
* Implement users table to check against, with hashing
* Create cookie upon log-in
* Put in authentication middleware for views
	* Could just indicate needs authentication by putting "internal" in name
* As internal page, implement commute logging project
