My home page!  Contains some professional information (resume mainly) as well as a few pages I developed just for fun.  It is served from my LAMP stack at home and can be viewed at [http://lenknerd.com](http://lenknerd.com).

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

Thanks to their creators for making these available!
