David Lenkner's Home Page
=========================

My home page!  Contains some professional information (resume mainly) as well as a few pages I developed just for fun.  It is served from my LAMP stack at home and can be viewed at [http://lenknerd.no-ip.org](http://lenknerd.no-ip.org).

The site uses [will use] the following packages;

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Backbone Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/)
* [js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie)
* [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/)

Thanks to their creators for making these available!

### To-Do Items

This site is currently under construction and there is much to do... in no particular order,

* Make the site.  It is just started, nothing but this readme file.
